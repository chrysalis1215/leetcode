# 2586 count-the-number-of-vowel-strings-in-range

# 题目

You are given a 0-indexed array of string words and two integers left and right.

A string is called a vowel string if it starts with a vowel character and ends with a vowel character where vowel characters are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.

Return the number of vowel strings words[i] where i belongs to the inclusive range [left, right].

Example 1:

Input: words = ["are","amy","u"], left = 0, right = 2
Output: 2
Explanation:

- "are" is a vowel string because it starts with 'a' and ends with 'e'.
- "amy" is not a vowel string because it does not end with a vowel.
- "u" is a vowel string because it starts with 'u' and ends with 'u'.
The number of vowel strings in the mentioned range is 2.
Example 2:

Input: words = ["hey","aeo","mu","ooo","artro"], left = 1, right = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: 
- "aeo" is a vowel string because it starts with 'a' and ends with 'o'.
- "mu" is not a vowel string because it does not start with a vowel.
- "ooo" is a vowel string because it starts with 'o' and ends with 'o'.
- "artro" is a vowel string because it starts with 'a' and ends with 'o'.
The number of vowel strings in the mentioned range is 3.
 

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 1000
1 <= words[i].length <= 10
words[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.
0 <= left <= right < words.length

## 思路
看题半个小时，解题三分钟系列
integer 指制定数组的范围，不是元音字符串的范围


## 解题

<<< ./2586.py

## 复杂度分析

- 时间复杂度 O(N) / N = right - left + 1 仅遍历部分数组
- 空间复杂度 O(1) 仅用到部分变量，未用到额外存储空间
