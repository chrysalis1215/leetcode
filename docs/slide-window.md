âœ… What is Sliding Window?

Sliding window is a technique used to reduce nested loops when searching or processing subarrays/substrings of fixed or dynamic size.

ðŸ§± Types of Sliding Windows

|Type|	Description	Example Problem|
| -------- | ------- |
|Fixed-size window|Window size stays constant|	Max sum of subarray of size k|
|Variable-size window|	Window grows/shrinks to fit condition|	Longest substring without repeating chars

ðŸ”§ Common Template (Variable-size window)

left = 0
for right in range(len(s)):
    # expand the window

    while window is invalid:
        # shrink from the left
        left += 1

    # update result if needed
